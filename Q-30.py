'''Write a Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute the area'''

'as , we know the formula of triangle area = 1/2 base*height .'

base = eval(input("enter the base of triangle : "))
height = eval(input("enter the height of triangle :"))

area  =1/2*(base*height)

print("Compute the area of triangle : ", area)

'''output - 
enter the base of triangle : 12.5
enter the height of triangle :12.5
Compute the area of triangle :  78.125
